# RoverMitra Main.py Optimization Summary

## ðŸš€ Performance Improvements Made

### Key Optimizations Applied

1. **4-bit Quantization Support**
   - Added `BitsAndBytesConfig` for 4-bit model loading
   - Reduces memory usage by ~75% compared to full precision
   - Faster model loading and inference
   - Works on both GPU and CPU

2. **Smart Device Detection**
   - Automatically detects GPU availability
   - Falls back to CPU if GPU not available
   - Optimized settings for each device type

3. **Memory-Efficient Operations**
   - `torch.inference_mode()` instead of `torch.no_grad()`
   - Proper device management for tensors
   - Low CPU memory usage settings
   - Optimized torch thread settings

4. **Lazy Model Loading**
   - Models loaded only when needed
   - Caching prevents reloading
   - Fallback chain: Fine-tuned â†’ Base â†’ Heuristic

5. **Detailed Performance Timing**
   - Step-by-step timing like main_backup.py
   - Performance summary with pipeline flow
   - Clear progress indicators

### Key Differences from Original main.py

| Aspect | Original main.py | Optimized main.py |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Model Loading | CPU-only, float32 | GPU/CPU auto-detect, 4-bit quantized |
| Memory Usage | High (full precision) | Low (4-bit quantization) |
| Performance Timing | Basic | Detailed like main_backup.py |
| Device Support | CPU only | GPU + CPU with auto-detection |
| Quantization | None | 4-bit with BitsAndBytesConfig |
| Inference Mode | `torch.no_grad()` | `torch.inference_mode()` |

### Railway Deployment Benefits

1. **Faster Startup**: 4-bit quantization reduces model loading time
2. **Lower Memory**: Uses ~75% less RAM than full precision
3. **Better Performance**: GPU acceleration when available
4. **Railway Compatible**: Works on Railway's CPU instances
5. **Detailed Monitoring**: Clear performance metrics for debugging

### Environment Variables

The optimized version respects these environment variables:
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: Controls GPU usage
- `WARM_MODELS`: Set to "1" to preload models
- `HF_TOKEN`: Hugging Face authentication token
- `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`: Model cache location

### Usage

```bash
# Run with model warmup
WARM_MODELS=1 python main.py

# Run on CPU only
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python main.py

# Test performance
python test_optimized_main.py
```

### Expected Performance

- **Model Loading**: ~10-30s (one-time cost)
- **Hard Prefilter**: ~0.1-0.5s
- **AI Prefilter**: ~0.5-2s
- **LLM Ranking**: ~1-5s (with 4-bit models)
- **Total Pipeline**: ~2-8s per request (after warmup)

The optimized main.py should now run as fast as main_backup.py while being Railway-compatible!
